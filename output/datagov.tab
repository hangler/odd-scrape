At the core of this system SISAME-3D provides a full representation of three-dimensional vehicle structures to support modeling applications including oblique and nonoblique frontal and side impacts and vehicle-to-vehicle compatibility interactions. SISAME-3D can be also used for finite element model tuning and as a workbench for exploring the space of safety-optimized designs. The combination of optimal extraction and simulation of efficient low to mid complexity models makes SISAME-3D a powerful and unique tool for vehicle impact research.
