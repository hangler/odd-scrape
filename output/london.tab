If you have any questions about these tools please contact Gareth Piggott.MacrosThe tool works in any version of Excel. But the user MUST ENABLE MACROS, for the features to work. There a some restrictions on functionality in the ward maps in Excel 2003 and earlier - full instructions are included in the spreadsheet.To check whether the macros are enabled in Excel 2003 click Tools, Macro, Security and change the setting to Medium. Then you have to re-start Excel for the changes to take effect. When Excel starts up a prompt will ask if you want to enable macros - click yes.In Excel 2007 and later, it should be set by default to the correct setting, but if it has been changed, click on the Windows Office button in the top corner, then Excel options (at the bottom), Trust Centre, Trust Centre Settings, and make sure it is set to 'Disable all macros with notification'. Then when you open the spreadsheet, a prompt labelled 'Options' will appear at the top for you to enable macros. To create your own thematic borough maps in Excel using the ward map tool as a starting point, read these instructions. You will need to be a confident Excel user, and have access to your boundaries as a picture file from elsehwere. The mapping tools created here are all fully open access with no passwords.

http://data.london.gov.uk/datastore/applications/london-jigsaw-app	United Kingdom				EN			A dazzling new app for iPhone and iPad plays with London’s geography in ways  that’ll have you gawping with delight. London Jigsaw scrambles up the prominent features of the  capital; it’s your job to drag them back to their appropriate locations.The  interactive puzzle is beautifully produced, with textured objects and  cute sound effects. Each level is  timed, allowing you to challenge previous high scores and link up to  the Games Centre for global high scores.The app also has a fascinating back story…The  puzzle’s creator, Catherine MacArthur, took early retirement from  teaching in Haringey and Waltham Forest to put the app together. She got  the idea from old ‘Victory’ puzzle maps of the British Isles. As she  explains…Catherine  first tried building a map of England and Wales from wood, with a  geological layer for the base and placeable county pieces for the jigsaw  layer. Her beautiful prototype is shown in the gallery above. But then  Catherine recovered, went back to work and the project fell fallow.It’s one of the  most inventive London-themed apps we’ve seen, and we’d encourage anyone  with a suitable device to give it a try. It’s not only great fun, but an  intelligent way to get a better handle on how our city is put together.

http://data.london.gov.uk/datastore/applications/multi-dataset-index-tool	United Kingdom		[Ward Profiles and Atlas (None, United Kingdom) http://data.london.gov.uk/datastore/package/ward-profiles-and-atlas]		EN			Do you have a number of different datasets that you would like to get an overall picture of what they’re telling you but don’t have the time or Excel skills to do it?With data becoming both more central to a wider variety of roles, and also much more widely available, assistance is often required to instantly ‘get a feel’ for what a number of datasets of interest show. The GLA Multi-Dataset Index Tool allows you to do this.This is a unique free Excel-based tool that can combine a number of seemingly disparate London ward-level datasets of your choice into a single hybrid dataset for simple analysis and visualisation.It works by converting your data into values which are then comparable within each dataset and also across all datasets; this then not only allows you to compare datasets with one another but to average the ward values of each dataset to create the hybrid overall dataset.  A video walkthrough of how the tool works using sample data is shown below:Advantages of the tool include:To create your own tool, all you need are the datasets you wish to use (at London ward level) and the blank Multi Dataset Index Tool (download here). Follow the step by step process outlined in the walkthrough video below and your tool will be up and running in minutes. Further detailed information about how the tool works is included hereIf there are any comments or questions, please contact Richard Fairchild. Copyright notice: If you publish any of the maps included in the tool, a copyright notice must be included within the report saying: "Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database rights 2012." Macros - The tool works in any version of Excel. But the user MUST ENABLE MACROS for the features to work.  To check whether the macros are enabled in Excel 2003 click Tools, Macro, Security and change the setting to Medium. Then you have to re-start Excel for the changes to take effect. When Excel starts up a prompt will ask if you want to enable macros - click yes.In Excel 2007 and later, it should be set by default to the correct setting, but if it has been changed, click on the Windows Office button in the top corner, then Excel options (at the bottom), Trust Centre, Trust Centre Settings, and make sure it is set to 'Disable all macros with notification'. Then when you open the spreadsheet, a prompt labelled 'Options' will appear at the top for you to enable macros.

One of the possibilities was to graphically visualise data of the socio-economic background of students attending different institutions. The GLA entered this Instant Atlas report into the competition to help demonstrate the differences in background of undergraduates entering universities. The report shows proportions of students from lower NS-SEC groups, State-schools and Low-participation neighbourhoods, and also proportions of young and mature undergraduates. Tip: Use the filters just above the map to show Russell Group Universities or the 1994 Group of Universities. To narrow the map down to a single region use the Filter by Region button. The data used in this report can be accessed here (Excel).The full analysis found in the report can also be accessed here (Word).Sources:Universities data comes from HESA.Census data for England and Wales from NOMIS and for Scotland from GROS.Indices of Deprivation is from DCLG.Level-3 Exam results are taken from Neighbourhood Statistics. Notes and definitions: Higher education (HE) students are those students studying above that of level 3 of the National Qualifications Framework, i.e. courses leading to the Advanced Level of the General Certificate of Education (GCE A levels). Note, the universities data shows data for undergraduates only, not postgraduates.  Young students are those who are aged under 21 at 30 September of the academic year in which they are recorded as entering the institution. Mature students are those who are aged 21 or over, also at 30 September of the academic year in which they are recorded as entering the institution. The information on socio-economic classification is taken from the National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC). The classifications used are: 1 Higher managerial and professional occupations 2 Lower managerial and professional occupations 3 Intermediate occupations 4 Small employers and own account workers 5 Lower supervisory and technical occupations 6 Semi-routine occupations 7 Routine occupations The performance indicator is the proportion of students from NS-SEC classes 4 to 7 (HESA field SEC codes 4, 5, 6 and 7) out of those from NS-SEC classes 1 to 7.Low participation neighbourhoods were defined based on the HE participation rates of people who were aged 18 between 2000 and 2004 and entered a HE course in a UK higher education institution or GB further education college, aged 18 or 19, between academic years 2000/01 and 2005/06. Level 3 Qualifications include achievements of young people aged 16 to 18 (at the start of the academic year) in GCE/Applied GCE A Level and Applied GCE Double Award and Level 3 qualifications equivalent in size to at least one GCE/Applied GCE A Level in 2009/10 and who are resident in England. The results are referenced by location of student residence. Figures are derived from the results of students in Local Authority (LA) maintained schools, Academies, City Technology Colleges (CTCs) and general Further Education Sector Colleges. Average Point Score Per Student is calculated as the sum of the points awarded to each student using the Qualifications and Curriculum Development Agency (QCDA) tariff, divided by the total number of students. English Indices of Multiple Deprivation 2010 Average of LSOA scores is the population weighted average of the combined scores for the LSOAs in a local authority district. This measure is calculated by averaging the LSOA scores in each local authority district after they have been population weighted. (England only) The Employment Deprivation figure measures employment deprivation in an area conceptualised as involuntary exclusion of the working age population from the labour market. A combined count of employment deprived individuals per LSOA is calculated by summing seven key indicators. LSOAs are ranked such that the most deprived LSOA is given the rank of 32482. To calculate the average of LSOA ranks, the LSOA ranks are population weighted within a local authority district to take account of the fact that LSOA size can vary.  For more information of all of these indicators please visit the source website.

The pressures of housing demand in London have grown in recent years, in part due to fewer people leaving London to buy homes in other regions.  But while new supply during the recession held up better in London than in other regions, it needs to increase significantly in order to meet housing needs and reduce housing costs to more affordable levels.  This edition of Focus on London authored by James Gleeson in the Housing Unit looks at housing trends in London, from the demand/supply imbalance to the consequences for affordability and housing need. This report is the fifth release of the Focus on London series.

http://data.london.gov.uk/datastore/applications/forecasting-domestic-water-consumption	United Kingdom		[Ward Profiles 2010 (None, United Kingdom) http://data.london.gov.uk/datastore/package/ward-profiles-2010]		EN			Ashley Woods from UCL has conducted research into forecasting domestic water consumption rates for London using amongst other things datasets from the London Datastore.  A brief description of the work is provided below.Forecasting future domestic water demand across London is likely to be a key factor determining water resource planning decisions in the future. Understanding the evolving demand spatially, will allow for planning authorities to focus the championing of sustainable water use strategies, including rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling, in the areas where the greatest benefits will be realised. These areas being those expected to have a significant demand increase in the future, which are located close to more energy intensive mains supply infrastructure; levelling the carbon playing field between decentralised, and mains supplies. Stage 1 was the development of a baseline forecast of domestic water demand across London at a high spatial resolution. ONS 2001 census datasets (KS160301_50_ GeoPolicy_LOND.xls and UV420301_130_ GeoPolicy_LOND.xls) were used to calculate mean household occupancy for each of London’s 24140 census output areas (OAs). Published household occupancy consumption figures from the Mayors Draft Water Strategy (GLA, 2008) were used to calculate a baseline domestic water demand for each OA for 2001. Stage 2 was to create a forecasting function through multiple regression analysis utilising variables that the GLA produce yearly projections for. In this application Ward projections were most useful so baseline demand forecasts for each OA were amalgamated into their encompassing Wards. A forecasting function was derived between baseline domestic water demand, Ward population and Ward population density (ward-profiles-2010_GIS.xls and gla_pop_proj_2009rnd_all_ wards_london_plan.xls). This forecasting function was then used to calculate ward domestic water consumption at 5 year intervals up to 2031. Results are in good agreement with previous work (within 4%) that has utilised metered data not publically available to develop a water demand forecast for the London Borough of Waltham Forest (Parsons et al., 2009).Figure 1 Baseline Demand in LondonFigure 2 GLA Baseline London DemandFigure 3 Demand Forecast 2011-2031Figure 4 Demand Change 2011-2026		Forecasting Domestic Water Consumption 	mailto:ashley.woods.09@ucl.ac.uk

London is a complex city of extremes with significant differences between various sub-groups of population. It is important to understand which groups are doing well and those doing poorly. This report, authored by Gareth Piggott in the Intelligence Unit, aims to shed light on some of the complexities of London’s labour market, beyond headline findings. It looks at employment rates and pay for different groups within the population and compares London with other regions and the UK average. This report is the fourth release of the Focus on London series following Population and Migration, Health and Income and Spending at Home. Reports on a wide range of themes will be released regularly throughout the year.See other reports from this Focus on London series.  PRESENTATION: What factors influence a Londoner’s pay and probability of employment?

At £900 per week, London’s gross weekly household income is 15 per cent higher than the next highest region. Despite this, the costs to each household are also higher in the capital. Londoners pay a greater amount of their income in tax and national insurance than the UK average as well as footing a higher bill for housing and everyday necessities. All of which leaves London households less well off than the headline figures suggest.  This chapter, authored by Richard Walker in the GLA Intelligence Unit, begins with an analysis of income at both individual and household level, before discussing the distribution and sources of income. This is followed by a look at wealth and borrowing and finally, focuses on expenditure including an insight to the cost of housing in London, compared with other regions in the UK. This report is the third release of the Focus on London 2010 series following Population and Migration and Health. Reports on a wide range of themes will be released regularly throughout the year.See other reports from this Focus on London series.  PRESENTATION: This interactive presentation finds the answer to the question, who really is better off, an average London or UK household?

The recent Marmot Review of health inequalities noted that “What a child experiences during the early years lays down the foundation for the whole of their life.” The Mayor’s Health Inequality Strategy for London responds to this by challenging all partners in London to create “conditions that lead to better early years experiences”.This chapter, authored by colleagues at the London Health Observatory, provides recent evidence on the health experience of children and young people in London. The report includes data about the Local Index of Child Wellbeing, infant mortality, breastfeeding, immunisation, injury, childhood obesity, physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, drug use, teenage conceptions and sexual health.  It reveals many areas of inequality within the city, but also highlights the ways in which London’s children are doing well. This report is the second release of the Focus on London 2010 series following Population and Migration. Reports on themes such as Economy, Income and Lifestyles, Poverty, and Labour Market, and many more will be released regularly throughout the year.See other reports from this Focus on London series.

It is designed to give an overview of London in terms of its population and its use of key public services. We use a range of statistics and Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses (PESA) data to show London’s share of expenditure on these services as a proportion of overall UK spend.This report covers a range of data including: Population, Earnings, Numbers of educational institutions and students,  Numbers on benefits, Police service strength, and Health service workforce and beds.Following the CSR we will be producing briefings that will provide greater detail on the consequences of the CSR on our city.

Of those leaving London 2,100,000 went to the rest of the UK and only 820,000 went Overseas. ●  The net inflow from Overseas was 560,000 thousand and the net loss to the rest of the UK was 640,000.●  In 2008-09 natural change led to 78,000 more Londoners compared to only 8,000 due to migration.The chart below shows the net change in population for each region of England and Wales for each of the three components of population change. The year refers to a mid-year to mid-year, so for example 2009 covers the change between mid-2008 and mid-2009.Back to Focus on London report		Chart Showing Changes in Migration, and Natural Change by Region, 1994-2009	http://data.london.gov.uk/datastore/applications/focus-london-population-and-migration

This alternative method includes only area used for housing and gardens - areas residents use, and also gives the option to include greenspace. In traditional density figures, Kensington and Chelsea had the highest rank in London with 137 person per hectare using 2009 mid year estimates. But if only land for domestic buildings and gardens is used instead, Tower Hamlets becomes the most densely populated area at 642 persons per hectare, followed by Westminster (551), which likely reflects the high proportion of high-rise housing in these areas.Back to Focus on London report		Population Density 2009	http://data.london.gov.uk/datastore/applications/focus-london-population-and-migration	
http://data.london.gov.uk/datastore/applications/population-estimates-1961-2009	United Kingdom				EN			In 2009 Barnet overtook Croydon as the most populous London borough. Prior to this Croydon had been the largest since 1966 when Lambeth was the number one. Barnet's population of 343,100 is the largest of any borough since 1951 when Lambeth had a high of 347,000, which is likely be overtaken soon. Click on the interactive chart below to explore the data.However, Barnet has some way to go before it reaches the largest ever borough population, which was Tower Hamlets in 1901 - 597,000, pipping Southwark that year by around 1,000 people, though the latter borough had the largest population between 1911 and the start of the second world war. (NB Although the current boroughs were only formed in 1965, albeit with minor boundary changes since, population figures have been calculated for previous years using historic Census data.)See the full dataset on the DatastoreBack to Focus on London report		Population Estimates 1961-2009	http://data.london.gov.uk/datastore/package/historic-census-population
